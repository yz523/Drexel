For Survey&Test Menu2, the new options are added to the menu. The modifying function is finished, I tried to modified all question type including their prompt, options and correct answers and there is no error occur. For take function, all question type can be displayed and input answers, but for matching question I did't let the match to be done in one line, the program prompt the options on the left column one by one and let user to enter the answer. The response of the survey and test is automatically saved after the take() is end. For the grade funcion, all question type can be graded, and the final grade is follow the requirement. In tabulate function, the tabulation is follow the question prompt, which mean I forget to put the user replies between. but the tabulation is completed and I didn't encounter any problem in my test.
