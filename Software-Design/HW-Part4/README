First of all, I fixed a bug that may cause program crush if there is no ts/ans path exist in the workspace - now it will automatically create the folders if the they do not exist. The two test files for this program(testsurvey and testtest) are also included in this zip file, they are located in the ts folder and the answers are in the ts/ans folder. All 6 types of questions and they can be display, modify, take, grade or tabulate correctly. For the new function of this homework, since there is no description about how to deal with the console outputs(except the menus) I think the safest way to add this feature is keep outputting the console messages while playing the audios. If anything needs to be hidden from the console, I can simply comment the corresponding println lines out. All console messages are now correcly with audios outputs. Except for some undefined words, as they will output errors in console window, such as file input/output or some other lines(according to the homework description we don't need to worry about it).
