First of all, I fixed the bug that the program will crushed if there is no ts/ans path exist in the work space. The program will now automatically create the folders if the floders do not exist. The two test files for this program(testsurvey and testtest) are also included in this zip file, they are located in the ts folder and the answers are in the ts/ans folder. They included all 6 types of questions and they can be display, modify, take, grade or tabulate correctly. For the new function of this homework, since there is no description about how to deal with the console outputs except the menus, I think the safest way to do is still output the consoles while output the audios with them. If something should be hide from the console, what i have to do is simply comment the system.out.println line out. All console outputs are with audios correcly except some undefined words will output errors on the console window, such as file input/output or some other lines, but according to the homework description we don't need to worry about it.
