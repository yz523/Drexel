For question 1 and 2, the answers are scm files. So they needed to be load in mit-scheme with command (load “q1”) and (load “q2”). The output should be:

q1:
My tree
a:'(0 0)
b:'(0 1)
c:'(1 0)
d:'(1 1 0)
e:'(1 1 1 0)
f:'(1 1 1 1)
Encoding
'(0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1)
Decodeding
'(a b c d e f)

q2:
0
2
4
6
'()

The screenshots of these two output are also attacked with file name q1.png and q2.png.

For question 3, I created a makefile to make it easier to use. Type “make run” will execute the q3.cpp file and output the answer automatically.
The output should be:

q3:
Pre-order:B ( B e ) B ( B e ) B e 
Post-ordere e e B ) B ( B ) B ( B 
Height:10

And “make clean” can clean all trash file, “make view” can view the source code for q3.cpp
