The sub_behavioral.vhd and sub_structural.vhd are the VHDL source model of ALU that suppport sub. sub_overflow_behavioral.vhd and sub_overflow_structural.vhd are the CHDL source model of ALU that support both sub and overflow detection. The tb_sb.s is the test bench file for sub_behavioral. The tb_sob is the test bench file for sub_overflow_behavioral. The tb_soss is the test bench file for sub_overflow_structural. The tb_ss.s is is the test bench file for sub_structural.
