The first thing I wrote in the trace document is instruction. It is the original code in the sum.asm program. The instructions are different from machine code. The second thing is the change of each step. The PC code changes each time when an instruction execute. The register changes a lot since there are a lot of variables and operations. The stack only changed three times, after each sw instruction. The third thing is the machine code, both regular machine code and machine code in hex are listed on the left of the program window. The last thing is address, it is also listed on the program code window. I didn’t encountered any problems, but I think this simulator and the program is difficult to understand and study.
