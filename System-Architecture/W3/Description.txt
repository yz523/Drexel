There 4 files submitted. The minmax_iterative.lst and minmax_iterative.c are the files produced by mips-gcc instructions. The result.jpg is the answer in the simulator. The description file is the summarize. The minmax_iterative.lst is the file contain both c code and mips code.For each mips statement, the comment is on the right after # symbol. Since we have to focus main() and MinMaxIt() functions in this assignment, I removed the rest unnecessary part. In main() function, there are 8 items created on the stack, and four arguments created. The main() function is simply initiate them, call the MinMaxIt() function once and then output the result using print_str and print_int functions. In the MinMaxIt() function,  there are 4 items created on the stack. There are three loops after the initiation, one for loop and two if loop. The for loop is outer loop(L3, the p++ is the follow loop L5), the insider loop is L6 and L7, the end of the loop is L4. In each loop check, the program jump to the aim loop as designed and execute the code. At the end of the loop, the answer stored in the arguments. At the end of these two functions, the items on the stack being deleted and the return address, stack pointer and frame pointer being restored. In the file minmax_iterative, the comment is on the right after the // symbol. It is similar with the comments in the minmax_iterative.lst file but it conversely explained how mips instructions set created by c code. In the result.jpg file, the console window show the answer is MinMaxIt = 2 33 which is the correct answer.
