HW1
============================================
Part 1 is written problems. The answer is attached in the pdf file - HW1.pdf.
For part A, all questions has been answered. For part B, I created two tables to list ’PEAS’.
============================================
Part 2 is Programming Assignment - Sliding Brick Puzzle
The corresponding functions are in different class files, the order is the same as the assignment asked.
For part A: State representation, the functions are in the state.java class file. The load function load the state file, the output prints the state, and clones function clone the original status.
For part B, the function is in the state.java class file as well. It checks the competition of the game.
For part C, the functions are in the Move.java class file. piecePossibleMove function returns a list of all the moves the piece can perform. allPossibleMove function returns all the moves that can be done in a board, using piecePossibleMove function. applyMove function performs the move in the state, and applyMoveCloning  first clones the state, and then applies the move.
For part D, the function is in the state.java class file. compare two states’s status.
For part E, the function is in the state.java class file, using the code provided from the assignment.
For part F, the function is in the HW1.java file, randomwalks function execute the 5 steps asked by assignment.
Before each function, the comment shows what it do and how it meet the requirements.
============================================
To use this program, type make in the console window.
The makefile will execute and build class files.
Then type java HW1 SBP-level0.txt 5, the output will printed in the console window.
The sample output is:
yz523@tux2:~/cs380/hw1$ make
javac  Move.java
javac  HW1.java
yz523@tux2:~/cs380/hw1$ java HW1 SBP-level0.txt 5
