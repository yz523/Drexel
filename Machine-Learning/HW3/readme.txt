To run these program, open the file in matlab.
For Closed Form Linear Regression, the program will output the theta(weight) and RMSE.
For S-Folds Cross-Validation, the program will output a list that shows S in different value and the corresponding RMSE.
Before running the code, please clear the work space, otherwise it may occur error.
