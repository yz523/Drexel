Program: units.cpp

This program divide the fluid ounces to different units.

The relationships between units are:

1 fluid ounce = 2 tablespoons
1 gill = 4 fluid ounces (fl oz)
1 cup = 2 gills
1 pint = 2 cups
1 quart = 2 pints
1 gallon = 4 quarts
1 barrel = 42 gallons

which means:

1 tablespoons = 0.5 fluid ounces (fl oz)
1 gill = 4 fluid ounces (fl oz)
1 cup = 8 fluid ounces (fl oz)
1 pint = 16 fluid ounces (fl oz)
1 quart = 32 fluid ounces (fl oz)
1 gallon = 128 fluid ounces (fl oz)
1 barrel = 5376 fluid ounces (fl oz)

The compute of the units is following these rules:

1.Divide the input by the biggest number to smallest number (5376, 128, â€¦ , 0.5)
   1.1 If the division answer is bigger than 0, let input become its remainder(using %), and continue doing division with next smaller number.
   1.2 If the division answer is 0, the program will skip current step and doing next calculation automatically.
2.Print out the answer.
