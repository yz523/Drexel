Program: tuition.cpp

This program computes the high school five year’s tuition. Including both each year’s and total years’.

The compute of each year’s tuition is using formula:

tuition = (1+rate)^(year) * 15000

The initial tuition is 15000 dollars, the rate here is 0.05, and the rage of year is 1-5.

The compute of total years’ tuition is:

total += tuition

Each time the tuition being calculated, the new value is added to total, and then got the total tuition of this 5 years.

The variables tuition and year is integer, and the variable rate is double.
