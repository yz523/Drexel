=====================Programming=====================
To run this program, import the KWIC folder to Eclipse and start the project.
The console window will ask you to choose input and output options, any invalid input will  be notified and lead to 'choose again'.
If you choose console input, you can input the text line by line, use enter button to finish the current line and move to the next one. Or you can copy&paste from other places. When you finished, you can enter '0' to stop and go to next step.
PLEASE NOTE, if you choose file input and file output, you will be asked to provide a file  name, and you DO NOT have to enter the '.txt' part. In other words, if you want to use 'test.txt' file as input file, you only need to type 'test' in the console window. The output part is the same, you only need to type 'result' if you want your output file be 'result.txt'. If the target file is already existed, it will be rewrite.
