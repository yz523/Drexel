=====================UML diagram=====================
The UML diagram is attached under the project folder.

=====================Programming=====================
To run this program, import the lab3 folder to Eclipse and start the project.
For the component pattern, the file class is the leaf and the folder is the composite.
For the visitor pattern, I used the same class name from the class diagram in the lecture notes.
The source code is strictly follow the composite and visitor design pattern.
For sample run, there are 12 folders and 7 files, in 4 layers.
After run the program, it will first output the readable system information, list all the folders and files, along with all information.
The total file and earliest files will be output after that.
