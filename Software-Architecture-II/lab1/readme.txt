=====================Programming=====================
To run this program, import the lab1 folder to Eclipse and start the project.
The console window will ask you to enter input and output file names.
PLEASE NOTE, you DO NOT have to enter the '.txt' part. In other words, if you want to use 'TestFile.txt' file as input file, you only need to type 'TestFile' in the console window. The output part is the same, you only need to type 'result' if you want your output file be 'result.txt'.
Any invalid input filename(not exist) will be notified and lead to 'choose again'.
