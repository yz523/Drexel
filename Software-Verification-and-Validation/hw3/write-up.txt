HW3 - Object Dependencies

For this homework, I used ad-hoc approach to refactor the code in client class file, in order to expose the dependency on the collaborator. By following the example ‘Breaking Dependencies: Pass the Collaborator’ in the lecture notes, I made the conn to be an object of the client class, and add a new method declaration that can pass the mock ServerConnection to it.
