1. Type "make build" first which prepare the program(files)
2. The "assn4" file is not executable before "make build"
3. The "make clean" can remove .class file and the temp file(drawer)
4. Not sure how to check the returned status code without output them to the
prompt(as required). So I wrote the expected results in the comments for each
step and printed out several times by myself.(works and correct)
